# chat-app
Chat application using react and firebase.

Application hosted on https://chat-2l32.onrender.com, to showcase on portfolios.

Install by cloning the repo and using npm i, then, npm run dev.

The app itself:

1.a) Create two users, with any name, avatar, or passwords. No restrictions on anything. Even though the password is encrypted, use something you wouldn't use on a real case scenario. Use a normal tab and an incognito one for different sessions
1.b) Otherwise, you can use the two default users I made, john@example.com and mireya@example.com. Both passwords are '123456'. Use a normal tab and an incognito one for different sessions.
2) Look for the name of another user on the Search bar and hit enter. If there-s an user with that name, it will be shown (case sensitive).
3) Click on the user, and their chat will be listed. Click on it
4) Send a message to the other user on the chat window to the right by clicking send.
